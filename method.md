The breathing technique popularized by Navy SEALs to fall asleep quickly is called **Box Breathing** (also known as Square Breathing or Tactical Breathing). It's a scientifically supported method that helps calm the nervous system, reduce stress, and induce relaxation, making it easier to fall asleep.

### **How to Do Box Breathing:**

1. **Inhale slowly** through your nose for **4 seconds**.
2. **Hold your breath** gently for **4 seconds**.
3. **Exhale slowly** through your mouth or nose for **4 seconds**.
4. **Hold your breath again** for **4 seconds**.
5. Repeat this cycle until you feel relaxed or sleepyâ€”usually within just a few cycles.

### **Why it works (scientifically proven benefits):**

- **Activates the parasympathetic nervous system**, which slows heart rate, relaxes muscles, and calms the mind.
- **Balances carbon dioxide and oxygen levels**, reducing stress hormones like cortisol.
- Proven effective at **reducing anxiety** and improving sleep quality.

### **Additional Navy SEAL sleep recommendations:**

- Relaxing your facial muscles, jaw, shoulders, and limbs progressively.
- Clearing your mind by visualizing calm, restful scenarios.

Combining **Box Breathing** with progressive muscle relaxation and visualization is highly effective for falling asleep quickly.
