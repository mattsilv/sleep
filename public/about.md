## Box Breathing Technique

Our guided meditations incorporate the Box Breathing technique (also known as Square Breathing or Tactical Breathing) popularized by Navy SEALs. This scientifically supported method helps calm the nervous system, reduce stress, and induce relaxation.

### How to Practice Box Breathing:

1. **Inhale slowly** through your nose for **4 seconds**
2. **Hold your breath** gently for **4 seconds**
3. **Exhale slowly** through your mouth or nose for **4 seconds**
4. **Hold your breath again** for **4 seconds**
5. Repeat this cycle until you feel relaxed or sleepy

### Benefits:

- Activates the parasympathetic nervous system, slowing heart rate and relaxing muscles
- Balances carbon dioxide and oxygen levels, reducing stress hormones
- Reduces anxiety and improves sleep quality

For maximum effectiveness, combine Box Breathing with progressive muscle relaxation and calm visualization.
